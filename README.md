A usual Hello-world to learn github
Hi! I am Adeeb and i am adding this line coz github asked me to. I have to describe myself here:
I am currently a student of Electronics and Communiction Engineering at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.
I am here to learn github and start my own projects in future.
I know Python and C. I am parallelly learning Machine Learning. And from now on i will be posting my updates here.
I will also add a repository which will include my lessons learned in LPTHW.(I haven't completely followed it though).
Thanks for reading.
See you later.
